manga_pannel.get_pannel_links

	description:
		returns all of the img links from a manga chapter link

	requirements/edge cases:
		doesnt use selenium: i dont want to, slow af
			uses html.requests for the html scraping
		downloadable images using urlretrieve


	explanation of internals:
		uses requests and beautiful soup to aquire the html
		filters for the pannel links

		it was found that the image links in dynasty is pretty consistent within chapter but not wihtin the entire manga
		it was also found that the differentiator for each pannel img was the same in the pannel nav bar

		note: 
			the differentiator is always at the latter part of the link and so 
			the code adapted prefix for the consistent bart of the link and suffix for the differentiator

		first we aquire the nav bar content for the suffixes
		then we aquire the first image link 
		remove the first image suffix

		then stitch both the prefix and the suffixes to get the img links



	theoretical faq
		question: why not use the <a> tags in the pannel nav to get the img link for each pannel
		response: using urllib and html requests cant use the specific pannel link and defaults to the first pannel page
