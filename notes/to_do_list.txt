make a website thingy to read from 
	so it wont be annoying to need to traverse folders for the next chapter

simplify the functions and make them more modular
make clear which one needs to be redefined in the specific website class

figure out how to do pannel level resuming and JUST THINK

create mobile-ify function for phone reading
	all the pannels in one folder
	seprate the chapters with a small image made from pillow
	make sure the names can go alphabetical order
		prolly use the index for chapter names

try and use the cookies and the get requests for manga dex and other sites
