==================================================
 MANGADEX
==================================================

mangadex uses blobs which I have no idea how to download from yet
when I do figure it out
i would be able to download youtube vidoes me thinks

==================================================
 DYNASTY
==================================================

i made the dynasty one but downloading photos is slow af
	i need to make a timeout then retry FUNCTIONS

they have consistent pannel page links
	ch1 pannel 1: https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/the_guy_she_was_interested_in_wasnt_a_guy_at_all_ch01#1
	ch1 pannel 2: https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/the_guy_she_was_interested_in_wasnt_a_guy_at_all_ch01#2
	ch1 pannel 3: https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/the_guy_she_was_interested_in_wasnt_a_guy_at_all_ch01#3
	ch1 pannel 4: https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/the_guy_she_was_interested_in_wasnt_a_guy_at_all_ch01#4
unlike their image links
	chapter 00

	pannel 2: https://dynasty-scans.com/system/releases/000/039/165/02.webp
	pannel 3: https://dynasty-scans.com/system/releases/000/039/165/03-04.webp
	pannel 4: https://dynasty-scans.com/system/releases/000/039/165/05.webp
	because pannel 3 and 4 were stitched together cuz a whole page drawing
	compare it with chapter 1 where there are also no leading 0s on the image links
	pannel 1: https://dynasty-scans.com/system/releases/000/036/237/1.webp
	pannel 2: https://dynasty-scans.com/system/releases/000/036/237/2.webp
	pannel 3: https://dynasty-scans.com/system/releases/000/036/237/3.webp
	pannel 4: https://dynasty-scans.com/system/releases/000/036/237/4.webp

	but the suffixes are consistent to the nav content
	ex1: chapter 0 nav for pannels
	<a ... >01</a>\n
	<a ... >02</a>\n
	<a ... >03-04</a>\n
	<a ... >05</a>\n
	ex2: chapter 1 nav for pannels
	<a ... >1</a>
	<a ... >2</a>
	<a ... >3</a>
	<a ... >4</a>


their pannel links always give the first pannel when using requests
	I can never get the pannel link image href to give me the second image of the chapter
	might be possible using selenium
	but not now

==================================================
 MANGAPARK
==================================================

manga park is fast af but you have to click the load all pages thingy
	would be nice to use selenium for those

or whatever you call this template for manga sites
https://ajinmanga.online/
https://housekinokunimanga.com/
https://www.chainsaw-man-manga.online/

there are some variance in how they store their images but most are scrapable

	among the three, only chainsaw isnt scrapable
	maybe its the blog sites they store it in??
	
	addendum: 
		hoseki has security where you cant (ctrl + i) 
		but you can still access developer tools witht the chrome settings 
		and can still scrape with requests
