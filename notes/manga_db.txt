im debating whether to use classes or use a database-like method to store the manga data

firstly, the reason for the data storage is to make the process more modular
	the download can stop and resume and doesnt have to gather the links all over again
	i can track what ive downloaded and not have to redundantly download pics again
	can have a reference for the chapter links and manga links

part of the title will be used to create and organize the files they will be stored in

==================================================
 CLASS BASED
==================================================

manga_pannel: object
	pannel_link:str
	downloaded:bool

manga_chapter: object
	chapter_link:str
	chapter_title:str
	chapter_file_created:bool
	manga_pannels:List[manga_pannel]

manga: object
	manga_link:str
	manga_title:str
	manga_file_created:bool
	manga_chapters:List[manga_chapter]

==================================================

pros:
	gives me practice in using classes
	readable storing of data
		I can have a json file for every manga I scrape
	polymorphism for future manga downloading endeavors
	attributes can be imported into json file easily
cons:
	slow development time 
		accessing is annoying >:((
		having to access manga then chapter then pannel is annoying to code
	annoying accessing a list of all pannels

==================================================
 DATABASE-LIKE
==================================================

manga_pannel: table
	pannel_id:int
	chapter_id:int
	manga_id:int

	pannel_link:str
	downloaded:bool

manga_chapter: table
	chapter_id:int
	manga_id:int

	chapter_title:str
	chapter_link:str
	chapter_file_created:bool

manga: table
	manga_id:int

	manga_title:str
	manga_link:str
	manga_file_created:bool

==================================================

pros:
	gives me practices in maybe using sql 
	faster and more intuitive way to get a list of manga pannels
	reusable databse for all the other mangas im gonna download
cons:
	no class extensions/polymorphism
		less flexible for future use
	inconvenient neat file for manga folder to summarize detials

==================================================
 ADDENDUM
==================================================

both can use multithreading fine(i think)
	i can think of ways to do both at least

I decided to use the class based one for the readabile json file
	i need practice in class accessing and turning themm to json files anyways
